If you want to use series as energy prices instead of fixed value (see economics.py and economics.json)
the series must be included in this folder.

Electricity:

	One can also run electricity_price.py or RD.py to genereate custom series
	
Natural Gas: 
    
	Historical series created with NGprices.py combining thermal-year data from 2019 to 2022. Files name: NG_year.csv
	naturalgas_price.py: general file to create custom series as trial. To be improved.
