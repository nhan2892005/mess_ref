"simulation years": int (if no ageing effetcs have to be considered, we suggest to set simulation years = 1)
"timestep": int 1-60 (is the timestep expressed in minutes). To run hourly simulations set it at 60
"latitude": flaot (useful for weather conditions extraction as well as PV and wind production)
"longitude": float (useful for weather conditions extraction as well as PV and wind production)
"UTC time zone": int 0,1,2 [UTC] es. Italy is in UTC+1 time zone EUROPEAN DATABASE
"DST": true or false (daylight saving time)
"weather": "TMY" or filetoread.csv (typical metereological year downoladed from PVgis or local database to be placed in input_test/weather


Below is given an example (Italy); copy-paste in general.json if you want to use these inputs:

{
"simulation years": 1,
"timestep": 60,
"latitude": 43.6,
"longitude": 10.3,
"UTC time zone": 1,
"DST": true,
"weather": "TMY"
