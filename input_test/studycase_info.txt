Each location (es. prosumer_1) has a list of technologies. Each technology has its parameters as this info explain.
During hourly simulations, technologies are used to solve energy balances one at a time following the order dictated by the parameter "priority".

"electricity* demand":  "serie": str name of the serie in input/loads from wich the hourly demand have to be read

"electricity* grid":    "draw": bool, true if the carrier can be wishtdawn from the grid
                        "feed": bool, true if the carrier can be feed into the grid

*or hydrogen, heating water, gas, process steam


"PV": 	"tilt": float surface tilt [deg]
		"azimuth": float azimuth angle 0 = south, 180 = north [deg]
		"losses": float losses in cables, inverters (if this technoly is not considered in your simulation), dirt (sometimes snow), over the years loss of power, shading [%]
		"Max field width": float >0 - optional
		"Max field length": float >0 - optional
		"peakP": float peak DC power [kWp] 
		"serie": "TMY" or INT [2005-2016] or file.csv if "TMY" production serie based on typical meteorological year is used
              		if INT [2005-2016] the PV serie of the specific year is used 
			if "filename.csv" a different serie can be used (upload it in input/production)
               		 "filename.csv" must be the hourly time series of PV production 8760 values [Wh]
                	 in this case 'peakP', 'azimuth' and 'tilt' are ignored

"inverter":	"max efficiency": float 0-1 
            	"peakP": float peak power of a single inverter
            	"number": int number of inverters

"battery": 	"nominal capacity": float [kWh]
		"max E-rate": 0-1 float charging and discharging rate related to maximum capacity [kW/kWh]
		"efficiency": float charge and discharge efficiency
		"ageing": true or false
		"life cycles": int number of life cycles to reach the end of battery life
		"end life capacity": float maximum capacity left at end of life [%]
		"collective": 0 or 1 0: no collective rules. 1: priority to collective self consumption and then charge or discharge the battery.

"electrolyzer": "Npower": float nominal power of one module [kW] 
		"number of modules": int
		"stack model": str 'Enapter 2.1' or 'McLyzer 800' or 'PEM General' 

"fuel cell": 	"Npower": float nominal power of one module [kW]
		"number of modules": int
		"stack model": str "PEM General" or 'SOFC' or 'FCS-C5000'
		"ageing" : true or false

"H tank": 	"max capacity": float [kg]
		"pressure": float [bar]

"heatpump":     "type": 1 = air-water (other types not yet implemented...)
                "nom Pth": float [kW] nominal condition: t_amb=5° t_out=35° 6000 rpm
                "t rad heat": loat [C°] temperature of radiant system in heating mode
                "inertial TES volume": thermal energy storage float [lt]
             	"inertial TES dispersion": float [W/m2K]
         	"PV surplus": true or false allow to use PV surplus to charge inertial_TES
                "REC surplus": true or false allow to use REC PV surplus to charhe intertial_TES

"boiler_xx":    "Ppeak": float [kWp]
		"efficiency": 0-1
